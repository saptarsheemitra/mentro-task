This project represents the task given to us for the frontend internship role at Mentro. The initial tech stack consisted of HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap (was going to use it for responsiveness). I was later informed to develop the application solely in React and hence I migrated it to component based React pages. Due to the time constraint I was unable to make it responsive as planned in the previous version but the structure of the `divs` have been layed out in a way that allows for easy integration of the `react-bootstrap` framework for extending responsivity to the project.

The use of `react-bootstrap` to develop the project further while making it responsive is something that I will surely do in the future. The current UI was developed on a system with display resolution `1920x1080` with an aspect ratio of `16:9`. I would be working on making this design responsive as well.
